# multiple.py

This is one of my very first programs written in Python. It helps me to parse sport matches from *hockeyslovakia.sk* as well as from *szfb.sk* and *msbasket.sk* into *csv* for further converting into google spreadsheet.

# hockey_slovakia_parser.py

This .py file itself enables to gather matches for multiple.py use or to form hockey_matches.csv if you execute it on its own

# szfb_parser.py

This .py file itself enables to gather matches for multiple.py use or to form florball.csv if you execute it on its own

# ms_basket.py

This .py file itself enables to gather matches for multiple.py use or to form basketball.csv if you execute it on its own
